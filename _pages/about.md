Welcome! I am carving my name on a tree trunk in the vast forest that is the internet. Thanks for reading this (many years later, perhaps) and thanks for taking an interest in me. 

My name is Wenrui Jiang （姜文瑞）, and I am a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in [Tom Haine](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/haine/)'s group at Johns Hopkins University. My main interest is in physical oceanography (see [Research overview](#Research overview) below), and I love to think about problems in fluid dynamics, modeling, geophysics, mathematics, and many other related topics. 

In my free time, I like to run, swim, ride a bicycle, paint, cook, and play the harmonica (this does not imply that I am any good at those things). When I was a kid, I wanted to become a Formula 1 driver or a battlefield journalist. Well, I picked up physical oceanography now... Anywhoo, I am enjoying my time as a student learning about the ocean, and would like to get better at it. 

Enough of "[I me mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seqaTuXkqFI)". Let me know something about you. You can find my contact information on the left side panel.

The most fascinating aspect of the ocean for me is its vast range of scales and the surprisingly many ways that small scale affects large scale. The dynamics of each scale are vastly different from one another, and so much is unknown. 

My most recent project is on the interactions between inertial gravity waves and upper ocean submesoscale filaments, which is at about the smallest scale possible for rotation and stratification to matter. I am running NCAR-LES to understand the refraction, energy dissipation, and pseudomomentum conversion in their interactions. This study is still ongoing, but I already have some nice-looking plots of turbulence. 

Jumping to the largest scale of the ocean, I am also interested in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC. It is perhaps the most important circulation to watch under anthropogenic climate change. We just submitted a paper about the freshwater variability of the Eastern Subpolar North Atlantic. (Yes, quite a very specific Atlantic indeed.) I am not going to provide much detail about the results here. Suffice to say, it is a paper that will put a smile on your face (I hope the editor and reviewers also feel that way). 

Meanwhile, we are finishing up a paper about the marine heatwave in Northeastern Pacific from 2014 to 2015 analyzed using a very similar tool. We identified two positive air-sea feedback loops. We plan to submit it soon (within summer 2025), since it is a hot topic (get it?).

Tracers, including heat and freshwater, are particularly important for the ocean at large scales. This allows us to understand many phenomena by tracer conservation, which is a linear PDE. [Green's function](https://essopenarchive.org/users/528978/articles/1215807-a-review-of-green-s-function-methods-for-tracer-timescales-and-pathways-in-ocean-models) and its adjoint are incredible tools to understand linear PDE. I have developed [a method that closes tracer budget on Lagrangian particles](https://essopenarchive.org/users/814820/articles/1262688-tracer-budgets-on-lagrangian-trajectories), which is inspired by the Green's function methodology. An analysis of the marine heat wave in 2014-2015 is conducted using this method, and I am hoping to submit the paper by summer. 

I am avid in developing open source software. I am the main contributor to the Python package [seaduck](https://github.com/MaceKuailv/seaduck) and the [poseidon viewer](https://web.idies.jhu.edu/poseidon-viewer/viewer/index.html). Seaduck can be used for interpolation, Lagrangian particle simulation, and closing budget on Lagrangian particles. Poseidon viewer is a visualization tool for a high-resolution global simulation called LLC4320.
